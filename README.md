<p align="center">ðŸ“œ The digital receipts of the future.</p>

  Tons of paper receipts are produced and then immediately thrown away, for the creation of which are used trees and a human toxic chemical, requiring thousands of decares of forests to be cut down and resulting in spreading of diseases.

  **Aumo** is a mobile application, accompanied by a hardware device and a web server, which aims at removing paper receipts by replacing them with a digital equivalent. Receipt printers of shops and restaurants will be equipped with **Aumo**. Clients will take their digital receipts by approaching their phone (through our mobile application) to **Aumo**, establishing a connection via NFC (Near-Field Communication) technology.
  Incentive for using the digital receipt, as opposed to the paper alternative, will be points which users receive when choosing **Aumo** over the traditional option. Points can be exchanged for bonuses, which can either be discounts or physical items, provided by the shop or restaurant.
